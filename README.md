# Portfolio README
Welcome Potential Employers! This repository contains all project files from my classes at Saginaw Valley State University.  
This is useful repository to get a feel for my commenting style and my knowledge of microsoft .NET development, espeically VB.NET.
I am about at the same Level for C#. I may be a bit behind C# in terms of my Java experience as I have never created anything 
except console applications in Java before. I also have included the project definition document, operational screenshots and the 
project files themselves. Unfortunately, I have no Java examples in this repository as an error with my server storage at the 
university years ago wiped out those files and I do not have any backups available. Please note that all Programs in the .NET 
Framework were coded and compiled using the Visual Studio IDE from Microsoft.

This Portfolio Contains Three Main Folders: Advanced VB Class, ASM and System Software, and Capstone Part 1. An Explaination of 
Each Class and what the folders contain is below:
1. Advanced VB Class: Otherwise known as CIS311 at SVSU or Windows Programming with VB.NET. It is an advanced class for the 
   knowledge base of VB.NET. The Folder contains 5 programs that demonstrate my coding ability and commenting style at that time.
   
2. ASM and System Software: Otherwise known as CIS333 or Intro to System Software. It was a hybrid class focusing on coding at 
   the assembly level and theoretical work to understand the underlying hardware and software That make modern operating systems, 
   programs and computers tick. The ASM Portion is the most represented here as it is the most hands-on section of the class to 
   learn how a computer works via interrupts and how technology involved to include virtualized environemnts as a third layer of 
   abstraction from the real hardware to prevent you from bricking your machine with a program as you could with DOS. This folder
   also contains a relavent reasearch paper on the topic of compatibility layers which was a required paper that I enjoyed 
   writing. As this class was done during my last semester in college, you can see an evolution of my coding and commenting 
   styles. Although Capstone Part 1 is a better example of it, I still attempted to maintain a high level of commenting to make 
   sure others understood what I wrote in this class.

3. Capstone Part 1: Also called CIS 422 or Systems Analysis and Design Concepts was the initial part of the Capstone project with 
   Securicom. Securicon is an anonymous company that did security assessments for other companies to make sure they were keeping 
   up with current methods. While working in a small group for developing a feasability study and IDEF-0 Diagram, most of the 
   ideas being my own, there were two programming assignments to test our programming skills and commenting to their limits. 
   Both of them were based and intended to emulate real world projects that would be commonplace for the type of work that was
   expected. Here you can see my best work and a further evolution of both coding methods and comments. I also was attempting to
   implement the principles of coupling and cohesion the most here and my data validation was a bit smarter when it was required 
   instead of the if trees that frequented previous programs, though some still exist, especially in the first program. 
   Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of the feasability study for you to view as the files were online and they were submitted
   via hard copy.
